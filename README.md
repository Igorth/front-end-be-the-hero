# Front-end -> To Be Hero

[Semana Omnistack 11](https://rocketseat.com.br/)
Learning concepts about Node.js, React and React Native.

## Instructions

First, if you don't have Node.js you'll need to install it:
* You can do a manual install from here: `https://nodejs.org/en/`. This will include Node and its package manager, `npm`.

* If you are on a Mac and using Homebrew you can do the following:
  + `brew install node --without-npm` (`npm` and Homebrew don't play well together)
  + `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh` (so, install `npm` separately)


Once you've got Node installed:
* `git clone git@github.com/Igorth/front-end-be-the-hero.git`
* `cd front-end-be-the-hero`
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* Check out the repo to see the git history: `https://github.com/Igorth/front-end-be-the-hero`
